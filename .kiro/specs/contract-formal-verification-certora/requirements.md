# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document specifies the requirements for implementing formal verification using Certora Prover for the ManifestPay platform smart contracts. The system currently uses Echidna for property-based fuzzing but lacks mathematical proofs of correctness. Certora Prover will provide formal verification through CVL (Certora Verification Language) specifications that mathematically prove critical security properties hold for all possible inputs and states.

The ManifestPay platform consists of two smart contracts:
1. A Soroban (Stellar) contract in Rust - main escrow contract for project payments
2. A Solidity contract (Splitter.sol) - payment splitter for fee distribution

Formal verification will ensure that critical invariants, access control rules, and state transitions are mathematically proven correct, providing stronger guarantees than testing alone.

## Glossary

- **Certora_Prover**: Formal verification tool that mathematically proves contract properties using SMT solvers
- **CVL**: Certora Verification Language - domain-specific language for writing formal specifications
- **Specification**: A CVL file (.spec or .cvl) containing rules, invariants, and properties to verify
- **Rule**: A CVL construct that defines a property that must hold for all executions
- **Invariant**: A property that must be true in every reachable state of the contract
- **Harness**: A Solidity contract that wraps or extends the contract under test to enable verification
- **Prover**: The Certora verification engine that attempts to prove or find counterexamples
- **Counterexample**: A concrete execution trace that violates a specified property
- **Soroban_Contract**: The Rust-based escrow contract (contracts/src/lib.rs) running on Stellar
- **Splitter_Contract**: The Solidity payment distribution contract (contracts/Splitter.sol)
- **Escrow_System**: The project payment escrow functionality in the Soroban contract
- **Access_Control**: Permission system ensuring only authorized addresses can execute functions
- **Reentrancy**: Attack pattern where external calls allow recursive re-entry before state updates
- **State_Transition**: Valid changes between ProjectStatus values in the escrow workflow
- **Balance_Integrity**: Property ensuring token/fund accounting is always correct
- **Pausability**: Emergency stop mechanism for contract operations
- **CI_Pipeline**: Continuous Integration system that runs automated verification on code changes

6. THE Specification SHALL verify that no operation can create or destroy funds
7. FOR ALL state transitions, THE Prover SHALL prove conservation of value (funds in = funds out)
8. THE Specification SHALL verify that Splitter_Contract correctly distributes payments according to basis points

### Requirement 5: State Transition Correctness Verification
