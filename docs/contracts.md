# ManifestPay Smart Contract Documentation

The `ManifestPayContract` is a Soroban-based smart contract designed to facilitate secure payments between clients and freelancers using an escrow mechanism. It ensures funds are held securely and only released upon delivery and approval of work.

## Data Types

## Workflow Examples

### Standard Flow
1. **Creation**: Client calls `create_project` to define scope and assignee.
2. **Funding**: Client calls `fund_project` to lock funds in escrow.
3. **Submission**: Freelancer calls `submit_work` with proof of delivery.
4. **Completion**: Client calls `approve_work` to release funds.

### Dispute Flow
1. **Conflict**: Either party calls `raise_dispute` if expectations are not met.
2. **Mediation**: Admin reviews and calls `resolve_dispute` to finalize payment or refund.

### Automatic Deadline Expiration
1. **Timeout**: If the `deadline` is set and passed, any user can trigger `check_deadline`.
2. **Cancellation**: The contract automatically cancels the project and authorizes a refund if the deadline is missed.
