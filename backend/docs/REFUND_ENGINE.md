# Automated Refund Processing — Policy Engine Guide

## Overview

The ManifestPay Refund Engine provides fully automated refund processing with a customizable policy engine, multi-level approval workflows, queue-based background processing, real-time notifications via webhooks and notification channels, and comprehensive analytics.

## Architecture

```

## Core Components

### 1. Refund Engine (`src/services/refund-engine.ts`)
The central service handling policy evaluation, approval workflow, processing, and analytics.

### 2. Refund Queue (`src/queue/refund-queue.ts`)
BullMQ-style background job processor that handles auto-processing and retries with configurable scheduling.

### 3. Refund Notifications (`src/services/refund-notifications.ts`)
Multi-channel notification dispatcher supporting webhooks, email, push, and in-app notifications.

### 4. Refund API (`src/routes/refunds-automated.ts`)
RESTful API mounted at `/api/v1/refunds-automated`.

## Features

### Automated Refund Processing
- Auto-approve refunds matching policy rules
- Background queue processing with configurable retry
- Synchronous and asynchronous processing modes
- Automatic retry for failed refunds (up to 3 attempts)

### Policy Engine
- Full refund window configuration (days since payment)
- Auto-approval thresholds (amount-based)
- Always-refund-under amount for small refunds
- Partial refund percentage limits
- Multi-level approval thresholds (first/second/third)
- **Custom Rules Engine**: Define rules with field, operator, value, and outcome combinations:

| Field | Operators | Example |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| `customer_tier` | eq, neq, in, not_in | `{field: "customer_tier", operator: "eq", value: "enterprise", outcome: "approve"}` |
| `payment_type` | eq, in | `{field: "payment_type", operator: "in", value: ["crypto"], outcome: "manual_review"}` |
| `previous_refund_count` | gt, gte, lt, lte | `{field: "previous_refund_count", operator: "gte", value: 3, outcome: "manual_review"}` |
| `customer_total_spent` | gt, gte | `{field: "customer_total_spent", operator: "gte", value: 10000, outcome: "approve"}` |
| `days_since_payment` | gt, gte, lt, lte | `{field: "days_since_payment", operator: "gt", value: 90, outcome: "reject"}` |
| `has_chargeback` | eq | `{field: "has_chargeback", operator: "eq", value: true, outcome: "manual_review"}` |
| `currency` | eq | `{field: "currency", operator: "eq", value: "USD", outcome: "approve"}` |

Rules are evaluated by priority (highest first). The first matching rule determines the outcome.

### Refund Status Tracking
Each refund has a full lifecycle with immutable history:

```
pending → approved → processing → completed
pending → rejected
pending → cancelled
approved → processing → failed → retry → approved → ...
```

### Refund Notifications
Notifications fired on every status transition:
- `refund.created`
- `refund.approved`
- `refund.rejected`
- `refund.processing`
- `refund.completed`
- `refund.failed`
- `refund.cancelled`
- `refund.pending_review`
- `refund.auto_processed`

### Webhook Subscriptions
Per-workspace webhook subscriptions with event filtering and optional secret headers.

### Refund Analytics
Comprehensive analytics including:
- Approval/rejection/manual review rates
- Auto-approval rate
- Average processing time
- SLA breach tracking
- Breakdowns by reason, status, payment type, customer tier
- Daily/weekly/monthly trends
- Date range filtering
